# Project Name: My First Project
This project is about creating a website for a company that specialises in providing baking classes to people. It is focused on advertising baking lessons to users of the site, who are interested in either learning how to bake or improving on their current baking skills. The website aims to persuade as many users as possible, to sign up with the company and join their baking classes. The name used for the company was BusyBakes. The BusyBakes website consists of four different sections: home, testimonials, schedule and about us. All sections are accessible via the navigation bar at the top of the screen and are placed on a single HTML page. Each section details relevant information required to convince users to join BusyBakes. 
As the first thing a user sees, the home page informs people upfront that BusyBakes is about teaching individuals how to bake and provides a sign up form, for joining up shortly afterwards. The testimonials page displays photos of people and the baked items they made during their lessons. In addition to their positively expressed opinions on their experience with BusyBakes. The schedule page notifies users on all classes BusyBakes offers as well as their level of difficulty. It also informs them on what day and time these classes are held. Lastly, the about us page provides the user with additional information on BusyBakes’ origins, uniqueness and values. All in an attempt to entice users to join BusyBakes.
